Task 5: Linux:

"You need to change the permissions of a file to ensure that only the owner
can read and write to it. How would you do that? â—‹ Provide a command example."

I'd run the command "chmod 600 [name of the file]" in my commandline from 
within the file's parent directory, or from another director with the relative path
of the file prefixing its name. 

Just tried it on this file.

Worked.
