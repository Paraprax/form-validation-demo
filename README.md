# form-validation-demo

A simple single-page HTML app mocking up a basic credit card info form, using vanilla JavaScript to handle the submission event, validate the user's input in each field before submitting the form, and alert the user to any unfilled or improperly-filled inputs.

Designed to run in Chrome and Safari.

v0.1 here is currently configured for Visa-format validation alone; Mastercard, Amex and Discovery options to come.
